## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
```

                                                    ↓
                               SharePoint Government Cloud
                                                    ↓
                               Power Automate Government
```

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Required**: All users must enable MFA for hospital accounts
- **Methods**: Microsoft Authenticator app, hardware tokens, SMS (backup)
- **Conditional Access**: Location-based and device-based access controls

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
| Role | PowerApps Access | SharePoint Permissions | Approval Rights |
|------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **End User** | Create bookings, view own requests | Read/Write own items | None |
| **Telehealth Staff** | Full booking access, team views | Read/Write team items | Approve team requests |
| **Manager** | Full system access | Full list access | Approve all requests |
| **IT Admin** | Full system management | Site collection admin | System configuration |

### Data Protection

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: System documentation, help files
- **Internal**: Room schedules, availability calendars
- **Confidential**: User personal information, booking history
- **Restricted**: Administrative settings, audit logs

#### Encryption Standards
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all web communications
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **Database**: SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- **Backup**: Encrypted backup storage with key rotation

#### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- **Email Protection**: O365 DLP policies prevent PHI transmission
- **Document Scanning**: Automatic detection of sensitive data patterns
- **Download Restrictions**: Prevent bulk data export by unauthorized users
- **Copy/Paste Controls**: Clipboard monitoring for sensitive information

### Network Security

#### Network Segmentation
```
Internet → VA Firewall → DMZ → Internal Network → Application Servers
                                     ↓
                              SharePoint Online Gov
                                     ↓
                              PowerApps Government
```

#### Security Controls
- **Web Application Firewall**: Azure WAF protection against OWASP Top 10
- **DDoS Protection**: Azure DDoS Protection Standard
- **IP Restrictions**: Hospital network IP allowlisting
- **Certificate Pinning**: SSL certificate validation and monitoring

### Application Security
