# Telehealth Resources Project

## Overview
A comprehensive PowerApps-based solution for booking and managing telehealth conference rooms across hospital outlying buildings. This system enables staff to view current room schedules, check availability, and submit reservation requests through an intuitive canvas app interface.

## Project Goals
- **PowerApps Canvas App**: Graphical user interface for room booking
- **SharePoint Integration**: Master schedule storage and reservation tracking
- **Power Automate Workflows**: Automated approval routing to Telehealth Managers
- **Legacy System Migration**: Transition from Excel-based to SharePoint-based scheduling
