## Overview
A comprehensive digital transformation initiative for Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, evolving from legacy Excel-based room booking systems to a modern, enterprise-grade Microsoft Power Platform solution. The project encompasses the development of a sophisticated PowerApps canvas application with 18 screens, 154 reusable components, and over 186,000 lines of Power Fx code, integrated with SharePoint data architecture and Power Automate workflows to serve multiple hospital buildings across the VA healthcare network.

**Current Status**: Version 0.1.3 in pre-release development, 85% complete in technical foundation with operational core functionality supporting telehealth room reservations, manager approval workflows, and role-based security controls. The project targets September 2025 for full production deployment (v1.0.0).

## Project Goals
- **PowerApps Canvas App**: Graphical user interface for room booking
- **SharePoint Integration**: Master schedule storage and reservation tracking
- **Power Automate Workflows**: Automated approval routing to Telehealth Managers
- **Legacy System Migration**: Transition from Excel-based to SharePoint-based scheduling
