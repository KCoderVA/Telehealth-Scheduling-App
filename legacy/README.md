# Legacy Systems Directory

This directory contains VBA code and legacy systems that are being analyzed and migrated to the new Power Platform solution.

## Files Overview

### VBA Conference Room Scheduling
- **VBA_ConferenceRoomScheduling_Fixed.vb** - Original conference room booking logic and business rules
- **ConsolidateOakLawnTables.vb** - Data consolidation routines for Oak Lawn building
- **ConsolidateOakLawnYearlySchedule.vb** - Annual schedule processing for Oak Lawn location

## Migration Purpose

These legacy VBA files serve as the **reference implementation** for business logic that must be replicated in the new PowerApps/Power Automate solution. Key components being migrated:

### Business Logic Patterns
- Room availability checking algorithms
- Booking conflict resolution
- User permission and role validation
- Email notification templates
- Data validation rules

### Data Processing Routines
- Schedule consolidation across multiple buildings
- Yearly schedule generation and maintenance
- Integration with existing hospital systems
- Report generation for management

## Analysis Status

### âœ… Completed Analysis
- [x] Business rule extraction from VBA code
- [x] Data flow mapping between Excel and VBA routines
- [x] User interface patterns and validation logic
- [x] Integration points with hospital systems

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] PowerApps Canvas App implementation (screens created, business logic pending)
- [ ] Power Automate workflow creation (approval routing)
- [ ] SharePoint List schema finalization

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- [ ] Side-by-side testing with legacy system
- [ ] User acceptance testing with Telehealth team
- [ ] Legacy system retirement planning

## Technical Notes

### Code Quality Assessment
The VBA code demonstrates solid business logic but lacks modern error handling and logging. The new Power Platform implementation will include:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit trails for all booking activities
- Enhanced user experience with modern UI patterns
- Mobile-responsive design
- Integration with O365 authentication

### Key Learning Points
1. **Room Conflict Logic**: Complex multi-building scheduling rules
2. **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level manager approval processes
3. **Data Validation**: Extensive business rule validation
4. **Integration Patterns**: Email notifications and calendar integration
