# SharePoint Integration

This directory contains SharePoint List schemas, configurations, and integration documentation for the Telehealth Resources Project.

## Current Implementation

### SharePoint Lists Architecture
The system uses **3 primary SharePoint Lists** to replace the legacy Excel-based scheduling:

#### 1. Desks List (Room/Resource Management)
- **Purpose**: Master catalog of available telehealth rooms and equipment
- **Key Fields**: Room Name, Building, Capacity, Equipment Type, Status
- **Integration**: Feeds room selection dropdown in PowerApps

#### 2. Reservations List (Booking Requests)
- **Purpose**: Central repository for all booking requests and approvals
- **Key Fields**: Request Date, Room, Time Slot, Requestor, Status, Manager Approval
- **Integration**: Primary data source for PowerApps booking workflow

#### 3. Admin Settings List (Configuration)
- **Purpose**: System configuration and business rules
- **Key Fields**: Approval Rules, Email Templates, Holiday Calendar, System Settings
- **Integration**: Controls PowerApps behavior and Power Automate workflows

### Excel Online Bridge (Transition Period)
- **Aurora120 Table**: Current schedule data import
- **Aurora121 Table**: Legacy reporting integration
- **Migration Status**: Phase 1 - Parallel operation with SharePoint
