## üîß **Troubleshooting Guide**

### **If File Picker Doesn't Appear**
1. **Check PowerShell execution policy**: Run as administrator and execute:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
2. **Try running PowerShell directly**:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts\PowerApps-GUI-Launcher.ps1"
   ```

### **If No Files Visible in Picker**
1. **Navigate up one directory** - The picker opens to the parent folder
2. **Look for `src\powerapps\` folders** or similar
3. **Change file filter** to "All files (*.*)" if needed
4. **Ensure files have `.json` extension**

### **If Conversion Fails**
1. **Check file format** - Must be valid PowerApps JSON with TopParent structure
2. **Try the demo file** first: `demo_telehealth_screen.json`
3. **Check file permissions** - Ensure read access to input file
4. **Verify output directory** exists - `scripts\generated_previews\`

### **If HTML Preview Doesn't Open**
1. **Check default browser settings**
2. **Manually open** the file from `scripts\generated_previews\`
3. **Look for browser security warnings** and allow if safe
